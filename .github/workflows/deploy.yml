# This is an example deployment workflow that demonstrates the recommended pattern:
# 1. Call the release.yml workflow to create a release
# 2. Implement your custom deployment logic
# 3. Optionally run load tests for staging deployments
#
# The release.yml workflow is kept separate from deployment to allow:
# - Different deployment strategies per project (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
# - Custom deployment logic without modifying the release workflow
# - Optional load testing based on environment
# - Flexibility to deploy the same release to multiple environments
