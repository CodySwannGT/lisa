description: This skill should be used when updating local Lisa projects in batches. It reads the project list from .lisa.config.local.json, checks out the target branch, pulls the latest, creates an update branch, runs the package manager update for @codyswann/lisa, migrates legacy CI workflows, checks for upstream changes, then commits, pushes, and opens a PR for each project.

# Lisa Update Projects

Updates local Lisa projects in batches by running the package manager update command for `@codyswann/lisa` in each configured project, which triggers Lisa's postinstall script to apply template changes automatically.

## Instructions

1. Read @.lisa.config.local.json to get the list of projects and their target branches.
2. For each project directory, checkout the target branch and pull the latest from the remote.
3. If you can't because of existing changes or a dirty worktree, don't do anything. Ask the human what should be done about it before moving on.
4. Once you have resolution, within each clean project, check out a new branch (e.g. `chore/lisa-update-YYYY-MM-DD`).
5. Check if `@codyswann/lisa` is in the project's `trustedDependencies` array in `package.json`. If missing, add it using `jq`. Bun only runs postinstall scripts for trusted packages, so without this entry Lisa's postinstall (template application and file deletions) is silently skipped.
6. Run the project's package manager update command for `@codyswann/lisa` (e.g. `bun update @codyswann/lisa` or `npm update @codyswann/lisa`). This triggers Lisa's postinstall script which applies templates automatically.
7. After updating, check if `@codyswann/lisa` appears in the project's `dependencies` (not `devDependencies`). If so, move it: remove from `dependencies` and ensure it's in `devDependencies`. Use `jq` to check and the package manager to reinstall correctly.
8. Check for legacy inline Claude workflows that need migration. For each file in `.github/workflows/` matching `claude*.yml`, `claude*.yaml`, `auto-update-pr-branches.yml`, `auto-update-pr-branches.yaml`, `ci.yml`, and `ci.yaml`:
   - If the workflow has inline `steps:` blocks instead of calling `uses: CodySwannGT/lisa/.github/workflows/reusable-*.yml@main`, it is legacy.
   - Replace each legacy workflow file with the corresponding create-only template from `typescript/create-only/.github/workflows/` in the Lisa repo. These are thin callers that delegate to the reusable workflows at `@main`.
   - The create-only templates are the source of truth for the correct caller format.
   - Key mappings: `ci.yml` → calls `quality.yml@main`, `claude.yml` → calls `reusable-claude.yml@main`, `claude-ci-auto-fix.yml` → calls `reusable-claude-ci-auto-fix.yml@main`, `auto-update-pr-branches.yml` → calls `reusable-auto-update-pr-branches.yml@main`, and similarly for all other `claude-*.yml` workflows.
9. Remove stale `file:` references to bundled ESLint plugins from the project's `package.json`. Previous Lisa versions copied plugin directories and added `file:./` dependencies; current Lisa deletes the directories but the `package.json` references remain. Use `jq` to remove these keys from both `dependencies` and `devDependencies` if they exist:
   - `eslint-plugin-code-organization`
   - `eslint-plugin-component-structure`
   - `eslint-plugin-ui-standards`
10. Remove stale `debug-hook.sh` references from the project's `.claude/settings.json`. Previous Lisa versions installed `debug-hook.sh` as a hook script; current Lisa deletes the script via `all/deletions.json` but the settings.json references remain. Use `jq` to:
   - Remove any hook entry objects where the `command` contains `debug-hook.sh`
   - Remove entire hook category arrays that become empty after removing debug-hook entries
   - Preserve all other hook entries in the same category
11. Check `git diff` to see if the project changed any Lisa-managed files. If so, examine them to see if any changes need to be upstreamed back to Lisa and do so if necessary.
12. Commit, push, and PR the branch to the project's target branch specified in @.lisa.config.local.json.
13. If you hit any pre-push blockers, fix them and upstream anything that needs to. Do not lower any thresholds to get around a pre-push block. Instead, fix the code.

For steps 4-12, use up to 4 parallel subagents to accomplish those steps.
