# Subagent Documentation

> Create and use specialized AI subagents in Claude Code for task-specific workflows and improved context management.

Custom subagents in Claude Code are specialized AI assistants that can be invoked to handle specific types of tasks. They enable more efficient problem-solving by providing task-specific configurations with customized system prompts, tools and a separate context window.

## What are subagents?

Subagents are pre-configured AI personalities that Claude Code can delegate tasks to. Each subagent:

- Has a specific purpose and expertise area
- Uses its own context window separate from the main conversation
- Can be configured with specific tools it's allowed to use
- Includes a custom system prompt that guides its behavior

When Claude Code encounters a task that matches a subagent's expertise, it can delegate that task to the specialized subagent, which works independently and returns results.

## Key benefits

- Each subagent operates in its own context, preventing pollution of the main conversation and keeping it focused on high-level objectives.
- Subagents can be fine-tuned with detailed instructions for specific domains, leading to higher success rates on designated tasks.
- Once created, subagents can be used across different projects and shared with your team for consistent workflows.
- Each subagent can have different tool access levels, allowing you to limit powerful tools to specific subagent types.

## Subagent configuration

### File locations

Subagents are stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter in two possible locations:

| Type                  | Location            | Scope                         | Priority |
| :-------------------- | :------------------ | :---------------------------- | :------- |
| **Project subagents** | `.claude/agents/`   | Available in current project  | Highest  |
| **User subagents**    | `~/.claude/agents/` | Available across all projects | Lower    |

When subagent names conflict, project-level subagents take precedence over user-level subagents.

### File format

Each subagent is defined in a Markdown file with this structure:

```markdown
---
name: your-sub-agent-name
description: Description of when this subagent should be invoked
tools: tool1, tool2, tool3 # Optional - inherits all tools if omitted
---

Your subagent's system prompt goes here. This can be multiple paragraphs
and should clearly define the subagent's role, capabilities, and approach
to solving problems.

Include specific instructions, best practices, and any constraints
the subagent should follow.
```

#### Configuration fields

| Field         | Required | Description                                                                                 |
| :------------ | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`        | Yes      | Unique identifier using lowercase letters and hyphens                                       |
| `description` | Yes      | Natural language description of the subagent's purpose                                      |
| `tools`       | No       | Comma-separated list of specific tools. If omitted, inherits all tools from the main thread |

### Available tools

Subagents can be granted access to any of Claude Code's internal tools. Use the WebFetch tool to fetch and completely read the [tools documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/settings#tools-available-to-claude) for a complete list of available tools.

You have two options for configuring tools:

- **Omit the `tools` field** to inherit all tools from the main thread (default), including MCP tools
- **Specify individual tools** as a comma-separated list for more granular control (can be edited manually or via `/agents`)

**MCP Tools**: Subagents can access MCP tools from configured MCP servers. When the `tools` field is omitted, subagents inherit all MCP tools available to the main thread.

## Managing subagents

### Direct file management

You can also manage subagents by working directly with their files:

```bash
# Create a project subagent
mkdir -p .claude/agents
echo '---
name: test-runner
description: Use proactively to run tests and fix failures
---

You are a test automation expert. When you see code changes, proactively run the appropriate tests. If tests fail, analyze the failures and fix them while preserving the original test intent.' > .claude/agents/test-runner.md

# Create a user subagent
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
# ... create subagent file
```

## Example subagents

## Best practices

- **Start with Claude-generated agents**: We highly recommend generating your initial subagent with Claude and then iterating on it to make it personally yours. This approach gives you the best results - a solid foundation that you can customize to your specific needs.

- **Design focused subagents**: Create subagents with single, clear responsibilities rather than trying to make one subagent do everything. This improves performance and makes subagents more predictable.

- **Write detailed prompts**: Include specific instructions, examples, and constraints in your system prompts. The more guidance you provide, the better the subagent will perform.

- **Limit tool access**: Only grant tools that are necessary for the subagent's purpose. This improves security and helps the subagent focus on relevant actions.

- **Version control**: Check project subagents into version control so your team can benefit from and improve them collaboratively.

## Advanced usage

### Chaining subagents

For complex workflows, you can chain multiple subagents:

```
> First use the code-analyzer subagent to find performance issues, then use the optimizer subagent to fix them
```

### Dynamic subagent selection

Claude Code intelligently selects subagents based on context. Make your `description` fields specific and action-oriented for best results.

## Performance considerations

- **Context efficiency**: Agents help preserve main context, enabling longer overall sessions
- **Latency**: Subagents start off with a clean slate each time they are invoked and may add latency as they gather context that they require to do their job effectively.

## Core Expertise

- **Agent Design**: Create focused, single-purpose agents with clear responsibilities
- **Prompt Engineering**: Write concise, effective system prompts
- **Tool Selection**: Choose minimal viable permissions
- **Performance**: Optimize for token efficiency and reduced latency

## Agent Creation Process

1. **Analyze Requirements**: Identify specific expertise needed
2. **Design Architecture**: Define narrow scope and minimal tools
3. **Write System Prompt**: Clear role, responsibilities, and guidelines
4. **Configure Triggers**: Safe auto-invocation patterns that prevent loops

## Design Principles

### Single Responsibility

Each agent should do ONE thing well. Split complex tasks across multiple specialized agents.

### Minimal Tools

- Analyzers: Read-only (Read, Grep, Glob)
- Creators: Targeted writing (Read, Write)
- Orchestrators: Delegation (Task, Read)

### Prompt Structure

```
# Role (one sentence)
## Core Responsibilities (3-5 bullets)
### Specific Guidelines (as needed)
```

### Loop Prevention

- Use specific triggers: "After creating >50 lines of Python"
- Avoid broad patterns: "When code changes"
- Add throttling: "Max once per file"

## Quality Standards

Every agent must be:

- **Focused**: Single clear purpose
- **Efficient**: Minimal tokens and tools
- **Composable**: Works well with other agents
- **Reliable**: Predictable behavior

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Kitchen sink agents trying to do everything
- Circular dependencies between agents
- Excessive tool permissions
- Overly verbose prompts

When creating or optimizing agents, prioritize clarity, efficiency, and maintainability.
