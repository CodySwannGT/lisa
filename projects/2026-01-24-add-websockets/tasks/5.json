  "description": "**PR Comment ID**: 2725651737\n**File**: all/deletions.json\n**Lines**: 1-4\n**Comment URL**: https://github.com/CodySwannGT/lisa/pull/72#discussion_r2725651737\n\n**Feedback**: The path `.claude/skills/coding-philosophy` is not tracked in git. Per established learnings, deletions should only target git-tracked paths. Either track this path in git before deletion or remove it from the deletions list.\n\nThe CodeRabbit bot verified: `git ls-files --error-unmatch \".claude/skills/coding-philosophy\"` returned \"fatal: pathspec '.claude/skills/coding-philosophy' did not match any files\"\n\n**Instructions**:\n1. Evaluate if the requested change is valid - NOTE: The purpose of deletions.json is to delete files/directories from TARGET projects, not from this repository. The path refers to files that may exist in target projects that Lisa is applied to. Evaluate whether this comment is based on a misunderstanding of the feature.\n2. If the comment is based on a misunderstanding, explain why the current behavior is correct and no change is needed\n3. If valid, make appropriate code updates\n4. Ensure changes follow project coding standards\n5. Run relevant tests to verify changes work\n6. Run `/git:commit` to commit changes if needed\n7. If hooks fail, fix errors and re-run `/git:commit`",
