# Add Auth System

## Original Request

Create an auth system

## Goals

- Design and implement a complete authentication system
- Support secure user authentication flows
- Integrate with the existing codebase architecture

## Open Questions

- **Auth Type**: JWT tokens, session-based, OAuth 2.0, or multi-factor?
- **Use Case**: Web app, API, mobile app, or third-party integrations?
- **Scope**: Registration, login/logout, password reset, roles, social login?

## Notes

- Security-critical feature requiring careful architecture
- Needs research into existing codebase patterns before implementation
- Should follow project's coding philosophy (immutability, TDD, etc.)
