# CodeRabbit Review

## Review Results

CodeRabbit flagged 1 issue:

### 1. Missing language specifier in fenced code block
- **File**: `all/copy-overwrite/.claude/commands/pull-request/review.md`
- **Line**: 33
- **Status**: Already fixed

## Verification

Checked line 33 of the file - it now contains ` ```markdown ` (language specifier present).

This appears to be a false positive - CodeRabbit may be reviewing against the base branch rather than the current working tree state.

## Summary

No actionable issues found. All CodeRabbit-flagged issues have already been addressed.
