Uninstall overcommit: `cd ~/workspace/qualis/app && overcommit --uninstall` (if overcommit binary available, otherwise manually remove `.git/hooks/overcommit-hook`)\\n2. Install lefthook: `cd ~/workspace/qualis/app && bundle exec lefthook install`\\n3. Verify pre-commit hooks work: `cd ~/workspace/qualis/app && bundle exec lefthook run pre-commit`\\n\\nNote: `.overcommit.yml` should already be deleted by Lisa's `deletions.json`. Verify it's gone.\\n\\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\\n- [ ] Overcommit hooks uninstalled\\n- [ ] Lefthook hooks installed\\n- [ ] `.overcommit.yml` does not exist\\n- [ ] `lefthook run pre-commit` executes (may have RuboCop violations — that's expected)\\n\\n**Verification:**\\n```json\\n{\\\"plan\\\":\\\"delightful-napping-lemon\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"task\\\",\\\"skills\\\":[],\\\"verification\\\":{\\\"type\\\":\\\"manual-check\\\",\\\"command\\\":\\\"cd ~/workspace/qualis/app && ls .overcommit.yml 2>&1; bundle exec lefthook run pre-commit 2>&1 | tail -3\\\",\\\"expected\\\":\\\".overcommit.yml not found; lefthook pre-commit runs\\\"}}\\n```",
