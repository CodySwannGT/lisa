The original CLAUDE.md content (Docker setup, architecture docs, AWS access, deployment) was committed in git before Lisa ran\\n3. Retrieve the original content: `cd ~/workspace/qualis/app && git show HEAD~1:CLAUDE.md` (or from git history)\\n4. Move relevant sections to `.claude/rules/PROJECT_RULES.md` (create-only, Lisa won't overwrite)\\n5. Organize content under clear headings: Local Development, Architecture, Deployment, Environment Variables\\n\\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\\n- [ ] CLAUDE.md contains Rails governance rules (from Lisa)\\n- [ ] `.claude/rules/PROJECT_RULES.md` contains Qualis-specific operational docs\\n- [ ] No content lost from original CLAUDE.md\\n\\n**Verification:**\\n```json\\n{\\\"plan\\\":\\\"delightful-napping-lemon\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"task\\\",\\\"skills\\\":[],\\\"verification\\\":{\\\"type\\\":\\\"manual-check\\\",\\\"command\\\":\\\"cd ~/workspace/qualis/app && grep 'bundle exec rubocop' CLAUDE.md && grep -c 'Docker\\\\\\\\|ECS\\\\\\\\|deployment' .claude/rules/PROJECT_RULES.md\\\",\\\"expected\\\":\\\"CLAUDE.md has rubocop reference; PROJECT_RULES.md has Docker/deployment content\\\"}}\\n```",
