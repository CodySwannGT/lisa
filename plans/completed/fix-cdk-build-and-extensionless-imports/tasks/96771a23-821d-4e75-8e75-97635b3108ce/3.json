      "Finding 1 (Jest extensionless imports) was invalid - Jest config loader requires .ts extensions unlike ESLint's jiti loader. Empirically confirmed: removing .ts breaks `bun run test --listTests`. Finding 2 (duplicate include) is acceptable as defensive fallback. Finding 3 (allowImportingTsExtensions) is correct for transition. Finding 7 (JSDoc preambles) references file names not import paths, so technically correct. No actionable changes needed from reviews."
