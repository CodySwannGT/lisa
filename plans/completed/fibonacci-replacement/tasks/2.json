  "subject": "Delete existing fibonacci implementation and tests",
  "description": "Remove the existing fibonacci implementation completely:\n1. Delete `src/utils/fibonacci.ts`\n2. Remove the barrel export from `src/utils/index.ts` (the line `export * from \"./fibonacci.js\";`)\n3. Delete `tests/unit/utils/fibonacci.test.ts`\n4. Verify the deletion doesn't break any other imports (check findings from task 1)\n5. Run `bun run typecheck` to ensure no broken references remain\n6. Commit: `refactor: remove existing fibonacci implementation`\n\nIMPORTANT: This is the TDD RED phase - after deletion, the old tests should not exist. We delete implementation AND tests together since we're replacing both.",
