/**
 * Jest Setup - Project-Local Customizations
 *
 * Add project-specific jest.mock() calls, afterEach hooks, and other
 * test setup here. This file is create-only — Lisa will never overwrite it.
 *
 * Common additions:
 * - jest.mock("@/lib/env", ...) for environment variable mocking
 * - jest.mock("@sentry/react-native", ...) for Sentry
 * - jest.mock("nativewind", ...) for NativeWind/styling
 * - jest.mock("react-native-reanimated", ...) for animations
 * - Additional expo-* module mocks specific to your dependencies
