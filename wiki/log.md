# Lisa Wiki Log

## 2026-05-14 - In-repository wiki setup

- Created the initial Lisa LLM Wiki structure inside the existing monorepo.
- Registered the monorepo itself as the primary project ingestion source.
- Preserved the existing repository and branch model rather than creating a wrapper repository.
- Recorded that `.mcp.json` currently configures Linear MCP only.

## 2026-05-14 - Initial repository and GitHub ingestion

- Ingested the Lisa monorepo working tree, docs, specs, plans, commands, rules, skills, templates, workflows, package metadata, and source structure.
- Captured full fetched commit history across refs and merged PR metadata from GitHub.
- Wrote source notes under `wiki/sources/repository/` and `wiki/sources/github/`.
- Synthesized Lisa architecture, template governance, workflow, requirements, vocabulary, project, and open-question pages.
- Advanced repository and GitHub state under `wiki/state/`.
